## Abstract
In this busy modern society, there have been many instances where people forget to bring their phones or forget to put them on silent or vibrate mode while going to work or attending important tasks, causing inconvenience to others. Therefore, I came up with an idea that if the phone could automatically switch to silent mode when the user arrives at a certain location set by GPS, it would be great. So, I tried to implement a simulation of this idea using Python's pygame for one person.
## demo
When you run the file, you will see the following files below and the arrow keys on the keyboard are used to move.

When the user arrives at the location where the word "company" is displayed, a tkinter window appears as shown below. This is a screen where the user can decide whether to set their phone to silent or automatically switch to silent mode later.

If "OFF" is selected, the following message will be displayed as shown below.

If you select "on," when you arrive at the company, a tkinter window will appear as shown below. In the middle, a random notification will ring and the message "Boss: Who is it?" will be displayed on the screen, along with an alert message that you have been fired, and the program will terminate.

### I decided to leave a simple implementation using Python here because I felt that just writing down an idea that came to mind suddenly would be insufficient.
